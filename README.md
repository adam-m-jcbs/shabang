This is a repository to manage various shell executables and such that I like to
have available.

### Executables/Scripts and Their Purpose

**`clin.zsh`, `clnote.zsh`, `clout.zsh`, `clp_state.zsh`**

A collection of `zsh` scripts that I use to log and monitor my time.  `clin` is
"clock in", `clout` is "clock out", and `clnote` is "log a note".  They are
mostly a personal project, but if you use them and have questions, let me know.
They could be improved.

**`theme_my_term.sh`**

A script that does magic, giving your terminal a makeover that is both
functional and aesthetically pleasing.  Seriously, check it out, read the
comments (because the magic is actually done by
github.com/Mayccoll/Gogh).

**`ssh_proxy_jump.sh`**

A manual, should-work-anywhere ssh tunnel including a proxy jump.  Do this more
automatically using `.ssh/config`, but sometimes you find yourself on a strange
machine and you just need to do the slick tunnel + proxy without config files.

**`rrnote.zsh`**

Work in progress.

**`net_list_iface.zsh`**

Work in progress.
