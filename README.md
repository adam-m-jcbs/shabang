This is a repository to manage various shell executables and such that I like to
have available.

### Executables and Their Purpose

**`ssh_proxy_jump.sh`**

A manual, should-work-anywhere ssh tunnel including a proxy jump.  Do this more
automatically using `.ssh/config`, but sometimes you find yourself on a strange
machine and you just need to do the slick tunnel + proxy without config files.
