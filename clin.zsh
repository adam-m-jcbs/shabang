## Clock In script
#   In collaboration with clout.zsh and clest.zsh, it maintains these files:
#       ~/.clock_log/clin_time      --> ASCII one line
#                                       if clocked in: the output of `date +"%F %H:%M:%S"` recording when you clocked in
#                                       if clocked out: OUT
#                                       acts as CLOCK STATUS (am I in or out?)
#       ~/.clock_log/YYYY-MM-DD.log --> log of that day's in/outs
#       ~/.clock_log/state          --> short, human-readable current status
#                                       "IN HH:MM" w/ HH:MM the time clocked in , or
#                                       "OUT"
#                                       TODO: it would be awesome to have IN
#                                       show time elapses since clock in, but
#                                       that would need some hooks/triggers for
#                                       every time prompt is redrawn.  Do it
#                                       some day if you can.
