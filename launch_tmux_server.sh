# This works for XFCE4 terminal emulator in Arch Linux for me.
# Supposed to work for other major linux terminal emulators and iTerm2
#
# Requires: 
#   bash (doesn't have to be your shell, just available), 
#   dconf-cli (or similar), and 
#   uuid-runtime
#
# What this does:
#   A sampling of color themes/profiles will be presented.  You can try them and
#   apply them.  It should "just work" if you satisfy the conditions above.
